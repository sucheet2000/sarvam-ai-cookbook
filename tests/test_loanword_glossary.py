"""Tests for examples/loanword-glossary-builder — the offline core of the glossary builder.

Written against docs/specs/loanword-glossary-builder.md. Every test cites the numbered
acceptance criterion (AC-n), invariant (I-n) or trap (T-n) it enforces, so the mapping
from spec to suite is auditable by reading the test names.

Five kinds of test are present:

    unit          one behaviour each, AC-1 through AC-70
    invariant     property loops over generated and varied inputs, I-1 through I-11,
                  including a sweep that re-runs the whole pipeline over both
                  normalisation forms of every fixture and demands identical keys,
                  scores and order
    regression    the exact numbers the spec measured on the shipped passage —
                  727 characters, 153 tokens, 116 distinct, 12 candidates, 4 of them
                  with no nukta at all, and exactly 3 false positives added by the
                  naive rule
    edge case     empty text, whitespace only, punctuation only, a single word, a
                  lone nukta with no base before it, a lone danda, Latin and digits
                  only, a word repeated 200 times, mixed scripts, text that is one
                  enormous token
    guard trap    TestGuardTraps asserts that the NAIVE implementation would have
                  been wrong. Those tests import no project module and pass today,
                  before any implementation exists.

The correctness of this product rests on facts that are the opposite of the obvious
guess, so they are pinned executably rather than trusted:

  * GT-1  a nukta does NOT mean a loanword. kitab is an Urdu loanword carrying no
          nukta at all, so detection recall is partial and the rarity scorer is what
          covers the rest.
  * GT-2  a nukta does not mean a loanword in the other direction either. DDA and
          DDHA carry a nukta and are native Hindi retroflex flaps, so bada, padhna,
          ladka, ghoda, kapde and bhid all contain U+093C and none is borrowed.
  * GT-3  U+0958..U+095F are Unicode composition exclusions and stay decomposed under
          NFC, but U+0929, U+0931 and U+0934 recompose and their nukta then vanishes
          into a single codepoint. NFD is the only complete form.
  * GT-4  the two spellings of the same word are NOT equal as strings. Precomposed
          U+095E and decomposed U+092B U+093C compare False.
  * GT-4b unicodedata.normalize can never PRODUCE the precomposed spelling, because
          those letters are composition exclusions. NFC(text) == NFD(text) for the
          shipped passage, so an input-equivalence test written with normalize()
          compares a string to itself and asserts nothing. That is why this file
          carries P(), and why every equivalence test asserts the two forms differ
          before comparing their results.
  * GT-5  re.findall(r"\\w+", ...) shreds Devanagari words and drops every nukta, so a
          detector fed those tokens finds nothing. Python's \\w does not match the
          vowel signs, which are category Mc/Mn and not isalnum().
  * GT-6  unicodedata.combining() returns 0 for the Devanagari vowel signs and 7 for
          the nukta, so a combining()-based guard happens to work here and fails
          everywhere else.
  * GT-7  str.split() leaves the danda welded to the word, so a category strip is
          required after splitting.
  * GT-8  the obvious phonotactic endings are Sanskrit endings: -aan matches gyaan,
          dhyaan, sthaan; -aar matches prakaar, vichaar, sansaar; -een matches
          praacheen, naveen.

Nothing here touches the network. Nothing reads a real SARVAM_API_KEY — the checks that
need the installed sarvamai package read type annotations and signatures only.

Names the spec leaves to the implementation are pinned here, because a test cannot be
written without choosing:

  * the offline core is examples/loanword-glossary-builder/loanword_glossary.py,
    imported as loanword_glossary; the API layer is sarvam_glossing.py in the same
    directory. The notebook name is the one the recipe validator derives from the
    directory name.
  * normalise, tokenize, nukta_marks, has_perso_arabic_nukta, word_counts, score,
    rank_candidates and render_appendix are the public callables (spec sections
    4.1-4.5); build_gloss_prompt and gloss_candidates are the API layer (4.6, 5).
  * Token exposes .surface, .key and .index; NuktaMark exposes .base, .base_name,
    .position and .origin; Candidate exposes .surface, .key, .score, .count,
    .first_index, .marks, .suffix and .reasons.
  * the module constants are NUKTA, PERSO_ARABIC_NUKTA_BASES, NATIVE_NUKTA_BASES,
    DRAVIDIAN_NUKTA_BASES, LOANWORD_SUFFIXES, REJECTED_SUFFIXES, COMMON_WORDS,
    W_RARITY, W_SUFFIX, W_NUKTA, CANDIDATE_THRESHOLD, SAMPLE_PASSAGE,
    BOUNDARY_STATEMENT, APPENDIX_TITLE, APPENDIX_RULE_CHAR, NO_GLOSS_PLACEHOLDER,
    REASON_NUKTA, REASON_SUFFIX and REASON_RARITY.
