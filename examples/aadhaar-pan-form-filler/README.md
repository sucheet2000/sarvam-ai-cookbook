# Aadhaar / PAN Form Filler

> **Privacy Notice:** This recipe is for **authorized form-filling workflows only**.
> Never store, log, or transmit extracted ID data. Comply with all applicable laws
> including the **DPDP Act 2023** and UIDAI guidelines.

A 3-step AI pipeline that reads an Aadhaar or PAN card image and auto-populates
an HTML form — built with Sarvam AI's Document Intelligence and Sarvam-M models.

---

## Pipeline

1. **Extract** — Sarvam Vision Document Intelligence OCRs the ID card image or PDF.
   PNG/JPG files are automatically wrapped in a ZIP archive before upload.

2. **Parse** — Sarvam-M converts the raw OCR text into a validated JSON object
   containing `name`, `dob`, `gender`, `id_number`, `address`, and `document_type`.

3. **Fill** — Placeholders in `templates/sample_form_template.html` are replaced
   with the extracted values. Extracted data is immediately deleted from memory after
   the form is saved.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Add your SARVAM_API_KEY to .env
jupyter notebook aadhaar_pan_form_filler.ipynb
```

---

## Output

- `filled_form.html` — the populated HTML form, ready to open in a browser,
  print, or embed in a downstream workflow.

---

## Security & Privacy

- Extracted PII is immediately removed from the Python process (`del parsed_data`)
  after `filled_form.html` is written.
- The demo image is clearly labelled **SPECIMEN — NOT VALID** and uses entirely
  fabricated data (Aadhaar number `1234 5678 9012`, name "Arjun Sharma").
- Never commit real Aadhaar or PAN numbers to version control.
- A local `.gitignore` excludes `sample_data/`, `filled_form.html`, and `.env` from the repo.
